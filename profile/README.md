## 💡 Overview  

**LuLu** is a free and open-source firewall application designed to protect your Mac from unauthorized network connections. It acts as a robust security layer, monitoring outgoing and incoming traffic to ensure that no application or process transmits data without your consent.  

Developed by **Objective-See**, a trusted name in macOS security, LuLu provides **real-time monitoring** and **intelligent blocking** of suspicious network activities. Unlike many commercial tools, it doesn’t overwhelm users with unnecessary complexity — its minimalist design makes it accessible to everyone, from everyday users to IT professionals.  

When a new or unrecognized process attempts to connect to the internet, LuLu automatically prompts you to allow or deny the connection. This gives you total control over your system’s network behavior and helps you spot hidden or malicious background processes.  

In addition to standard firewall functionality, LuLu supports **persistent rules**, allowing users to whitelist trusted applications permanently while keeping tight restrictions on the rest. The software runs silently in the background, ensuring system performance remains unaffected.  

Perfect for users who prioritize **privacy and security**, LuLu is a must-have for anyone looking to safeguard their Mac from potential data leaks, malware communications, and tracking attempts.
